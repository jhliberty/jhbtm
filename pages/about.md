I have a tendency to seek the novel. Intense curiousity has been a defining characteristic of my life. I seek to understand and in that journey I come across many interesting things. So much so that I was encouraged to start a blog and document my voyage into knowledge. This is my humble attempt to do so. 

I hope you find my posts of use - feel free to chat with me on the [Gitter for Seeds.js](https://gitter.io/terminalvelocity/seeds.js)
